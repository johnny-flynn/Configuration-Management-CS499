Software Configuration Management is the idea that every change made to a file within the code bank is monitored and organized throughout the software development lifecycle. 
It is so essential due to its ability to allow programmers to develop anywhere and anytime, even simultaneously across the globe. Configuration Management software such as GitHub 
or GitLab are essential to the modern programmer for a variety of reasons. The first is they allow a version control system that allows different development branches within the 
same project. As I previously stated version control allows different programmers to all develop worry free at the same time from everywhere in the globe and the software keeps 
track of versions and merges. If there is a direct conflict on one line the programmers simply merge it themselves. Branching allows for programmers to make cheap and copies of 
a project and test specific things and merge later when they work. This style of branching allows teams to keep a solid stable build of their code published at all time while 
also experimenting on a separate branch. This style of version control is known as a baseline. In the scenario above the baseline would be the stable release on the main branch 
while the development branch is still being worked on. Another Piece of Configuration Management is Configuration Identification. Configuration Identification is all about classifying 
the scope of a project in a way that is clear so even those that do not fully understand the nitty gritty of the project are able to have a clear idea of the goal is and what 
is happening.
